Advanced Python Review Exercise 1 until about 2:40-ish
=================================
Write an abstract base class with a property 'n' and a __str__ method

In a new module write a class called 'NumberFun' inheriting from your abstract base class
Provide the property as expected by the ABC
This property will be validated as a positive integer
Write decorated methods to get and set the property
Invalid entries should default to 1 (or thow an exception)
Use 'name-mangling' for the actual property

Write methods to return the square of 'n' and the square root of 'n'   ( sqrt = n**0.5 # returns square root of n )

Declare a __str__ method which returns the number, the square of the number and the square root

Exercise the code to show it works as expected ( if __name__ ...)
Try to access the name-mangled property directly from outside an instance of the class.
e.g.    t = myInst.__num # (should fail)
See if you can set a value for this name-mangled property
e.g.    myInst.__num = 99 # this seems to work but...

At the end, some of you may like to show what you built

Optional
--------
Write a method in your class which finds out if the integer is odd or even
Write another method which finds out if the number is itself a square number
Use these functions in your __str__ method

Extend your class into a new class that also takes a boolean values
If the boolean is set to True, your __str__ method should also show todays date

Write a class method which will be the total of all values of 'n' across all instances

Is it possible to make a class that inherits from this abstract base 
and that does NOT implement the properties and methods of the abstract base?
