Advanced Python
===============
Toby Dussek


all my code will be here:
https://github.com/onionmccabbage/PythonAdvOct2024

9:30 start
11:00 morning break
12:30 lunch (1 hr)
3:00 afternoon break
4:30 end

You will need:
- a copy of Python 3.x
- an editor (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm etc.)
- internet, able to install python libraries (e.g. requests library)

Python code lives in classes (or in functions), in modules, which live in packages (folders)

Monday
> intro and welcome
  > what do you currently know
  > what do you want to know
> classes 
> what is -> str all about....?
> mini review exercise
> abstract and concrete classes
- validate types: isinstance, type, int(float())
> inheritance
> name mangled members
<-> using slots with classes
- if __name__== '__main__'
> using decorators
- which kind of Python...
> after lunch review
- functional programming: map, filter and reduce  
- functional programming: parameters
- comprehensions, generators and yield
- Loading local and remote data (requests)

Tuesday
- processing text/json
  - json.loads(rsisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite, text, bytes, json
- redirect stdout
- databases) takes JSON and returns Python structure
  - json.dumps() takes Python structure and returns JSON
- pe
  see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
- other db connections
- Create, Read and Update (and Delete) - CRUD operations
- populate db with sample data
- read and nicely format values from the db
- explore external API as a remote data source for JSON
- after lunch review exercise 
  ask questions, help each other, share code
- we will be using the 'requests' library
  (you may come across the urllib.requests which is the old-skool way of doing things)

Wednesday
- context manager to switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
- networking server/client (microservices)
- overview of Flask
- doctest
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
- after lunch lab exercise
- unittest and pytest see https://docs.pytest.org/

Thursday
- profiling: timings etc. (cprofile)
- multithreading, also limits of mutlithreading concurrency
  - how threads are done
  - concurrency and resources (lock shared resources)
- the global Interpreter Lock (GIL) will affect threading performance
  the classic cpython will be stymied by the GIL
  jython (Java) an ironpython (.NET) are NOT limited in this way
- using thread locks
- using thread events
- Python has -O to optimize code (especially useful for threading)
  -O will attempt to optimize the code; especially good for threading
- logging, context manager, often we log by time-stamp
- after lunch review
- named tuple, zip, deque, iter etc
- end of course feedbacks (internal and Neueda)
